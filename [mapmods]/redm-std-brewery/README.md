Thank you for your recent purchase!


These interiors are two different ymaps and are under the map. You will need to have portals to get in and out of them. 
The main floor interior is in St Denis, while the Brewery is north and away from St. Denis to avoid stress on servers. 

Make sure the teleport you use adds time to go from one place to another. The floor in the Brewery needs a half second to load, and if you go there instantly you will fall through the map. I'd recommend adding at least 1000 miliseconds while going from one place to another in your teleport script if it instantly teleports.
